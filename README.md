# Survival-101

This is an upload of a 2011 archived version of Davidii's classic Suvival 101 game from many years ago. I have done nothing to edit it, simply uploaded here for the convenience of others.

If you want the full experience, since this version undoubtedly does not work in the modern Roblox engine, it is recommended you use Novetus. Furthermore, you'll be able to nostalgia trip as you will experience it as it was then, with the old GUI, sounds and mechanics. 

I dont claim at all anything created here, this is all Davidii's work, and credits to Scarfacial for generously providing this copy.
